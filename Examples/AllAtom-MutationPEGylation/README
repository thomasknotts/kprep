In this example we will be mutating and then PEGylating the protein PDB ID: 1XPB
While these will be done together, they can be done separate. The user is 
responsible to identify where changes need to be made so the scripts run on 
their model. A more detailed explaination of the variables and functions can be
found on the group lab notebook: KPrep/All-atom PEGylation.

The general procedure will be as follows:
1. Mutate the residue
2. Generate PEG on the mutated residue

The mutant used in the example is PDC as this is commonly used in-lab to site-
specifically PEGylate a protein. PDC and PEG coordinates are included and
are necessary for this example. However, PDC can be swapped for another mutant, 
the only requirement for alternate mutants is a proper PDB coordinate file.

Step 1: Mutate the proper residue
- Input the proper USER variables in s-mutateResidue.py script
- run the python script s-AllAtom.mutateResidue.py

Step 2: Generate the PEG monomer attached to our mutant
- Input the proper USER and PDB-BASED variables in s-AllAtom.genPEG.py
  -- In this example we want to PEGylate on the mutant residue, thus 
     pegRes = resSeq (from mutateResidue)
- run the python script s-AllAtom.genPEG.py
