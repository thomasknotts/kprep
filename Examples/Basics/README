This is a very basic example of how to use KPrep to read files from
the web servers we use in this group, and output files that are ready
for simulation. The all-atom example is for CHARMM simulation, and 
the coarse-grain example is for LAMMPS simuation using the USER-KNOTTS
package. 

The all-atom example shows how you can customize atom objects easily
if you need to make changes to the read file.

The coarse-grain example shows how you can take the complicated 
process of transforming simulations inputs, and makes it easy to 
read, modify (if necessary) and output.

For more information about KPrep please see the lab notebook section
titled KPrep.

To run the example simply run the KPrepExamply.py script. This script
has been marked to show how each of the different Kprep packages are 
interconnected.
